Which type of fruit does Anna have the most?  \n\n![Alt text](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52548098026_1e1444355e.jpg)\n\nAs you can see from the picture above, the number of bananas is the highest.  \nSo what would it look like if we converted the above graph into a bar graph? Look here.  \n![Alt text](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52548647123_b333018534_z.jpg)\n\nHow about a bar chart? Very simple, isn\'t it? It always shows us visually the comparison of the quantities between different kinds. Of course, you can also try to draw the bar chart with your favorite pattern. Try it out!\n\n## **The bar graph can also be horizontal!**\nThe bars in the above graphs are all vertical. Let\'s try to draw horizontal bar graphs!\n\n## **Example**\nA teacher in an elementary school is counting the students\' favorite sports.

Otherwise, we may misunderstand the information given to us by the graphs.\n\n### **Could you figure out the following questions?** ###\n![Alt text](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52490839823_8e124a65cd_z.jpg)','[{\"question\": \"which of the people is the tallest?\", \"choices\": [\"Anna\", \" Lily\", \"Jack\", \"Tom\"], \"answer\": \"2\"}, {\"question\": \" Which of the people is the shortest?\", \"choices\": [\"Anna\", \"Lily\", \"Jack\", \"Tom\"], \"answer\": \"0\"}, {\"question\": \"How tall is Jack in inches?\", \"choices\": [\"60\", \"48\", \"36\", \"72\"], \"answer\": \"3\"}, {\"question\": \"How many inches taller is Tom than Lily?\", \"choices\": [\"23\", \"12\", \"21\", \"15\"], \"answer\": \"1\"}]'),(4,4,'# **Line Plots** ##\r Level: Math for 2nd Grade  \r ## **What is Line Plots?** ##\r A **line plot** is a graph that represents data on a number line using crosses, dots, or any other symbols. Each marker represents a specific quantity, which is the scale of the graph. The number of times a symbol is shown represents how many times a piece of data has occurred. The category of the data is indicated on the number line. We can visually draw marks or symbols on top of the number line to represent each category of variables.\r \r ## **Example** ##\r Let\'s look at the following graph. This is a **line plot** which uses the \"<span style=\"color:red\">X</span>\" above the number line to show the number of the <span style=\"color:green\">students</span> who are absent from school, and the numbers on the number line represent the <span style=\"color:green\">specific number of days</span> student absent.  \r \r ![Alt Text](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52525589060_3b4fa89ac9_z.jpg)  \r \r Based on this picture, how many students were absent from school during the three days? The answer is one. We can see that there is only one <span style=\"color:red\">X</span> above the number line 3.  \r \r How many students were absent for three days or other or more? Let\'s start by looking at the fact that there is only one student who is absent for three days and only two students who are absent for seven or more days. 1 + 2 = 3, so the answer is 3.  \r \r ## How to make a line chart?   \r ![Alt Text](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52524645962_6ff9fa6025_c.jpg)\r \r A line chart is a convenient way to graphically represent data. To create a line chart, follow these steps:  \r \r + Step 1: Determine the categories of the data. In the example above, data was collected for 4 categories of ice cream flavors: chocolate, strawberry, orange, and vanilla.  \r + \r + Step 2: Calculate the frequency of each category and represent it using any symbol of your choice. For example, if five kids like chocolate, we draw five symbols (\'x\') above the chocolate flavor. However, using only one type of symbol in the whole graph is essential. For example, we will not use a dot or cross in a line graph to represent the same thing.  \r + \r + Step 3: Mention labels and scales. Labels are what we write below the categories in the number line. For example, in the figure above, \"favorite flavor\" is the label. The scale is the unit or number that each symbol represents. In the figure above, the scale is \"1 x = one child\".  \r \r However, when we use 1 unit as the scale, you may find many places where the scale is not used. Therefore, when the scale is not mentioned, we treat it as 1 unit. Now let\'s understand how to analyze or read a line graph.  \r \r \r ### **Could you figure out the following questions?** ###\r \r ![Alt Text](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52525390954_1c6a50c529_c.jpg)\r ','[{\"question\": \"According to the chart above, how many books were sold on Friday?\", \"choices\": [\"30\", \"40\", \"50\", \"60\"], \"answer\": \"2\"},{\"question\": \"According to the chart above, how many books were sold on Saturday?\", \"choices\": [\"30\", \"40\", \"50\", \"60\"], \"answer\": \"3\"}, {\"question\": \"According to the chart above, how many books were sold on Friday and Saturday?\", \"choices\": [\"70\", \"40\", \"50\", \"80\"], \"answer\": \"3\"}, {\"question\": \"What day(s) did you sell 50 books?\", \"choices\": [\"Monday & Wednesday\", \"Thursday & Friday\", \"Tuesday & Sunday\", \" Monday & Saturday \"], \"answer\": \"1\"}]'),(5,5,'# **Division** ##\r Level: Math for 3rd Grade   \r \r ## **What is Division**   \r The division is the fourth of the basic mathematical operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division). Division means dividing the whole item or a group of objects or dividing them into equal groups. You use division when you need to divide a larger number into smaller and equal parts. Division is represented by \"/\" symbol.\r \r ## **Example** ##\r We can better understand the deconstruction method through some examples. First, we can use division as a way to share. For example, you have ten candies, but you have to share this candy with five people. Everyone surely wants the same amount of candy. In this case, 10 is the **dividend**, and 5 is the **divisor**. Therefore, we can get an equation: \"10 / 5\". Finally, we can get that each person can get two candies on average. Then, 2 is the quotient.\r \r ![](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52490839903_eaec7a81f2_k.jpg)  \r Just like the above picture, we divide the twelve candies in the bottle into four smaller, equal groups that are divisible. There are three candies in each bowl.\r \r ## **Not all numbers are divisible** #\r ![](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52490567014_7759518b0b_c.jpg)  \r When the divisor cannot be divided by the number of divisors, a \"leftovers\" is given, called the remainder. Remainder is the remaining number that is left over after division. In the above picture, the remainder is 1.  \r \r For example, if you want to divide 6 by 20, you will find that 6 does not divide 20 evenly. the final quotient is 3, and the remainder is 2. We will get \"20 / 6 = 3  with remainder 2\". We write the remainder after an \"r\" in the answer.\r \r ## **Could you figure out the following questions?**  \r Mom baked twenty-five cookies, and asked you to share it with your friends.

When we multiply numbers, it is called multiplication. If we need to add the same number more than once, we can use multiplication to do the operation; therefore, multiplication is an extended edition. Multiplication is represented by the \"x\" symbol.\n\nFor example, \"2 x 4\" we can say \"two multiplied by four\" or \"two times four.\"   \n\nThe first number we multiply by is the number of items in each group. And the second number(the number after \"x\" sign)is the number of groups.  \n\nLet us say there are two pieces of apples in each group, and there are four groups. So, there are three groups of two pieces of apples each. How many apples do we have? That is \"2 + 2 + 2 + 2,\" which makes eight pieces of apples. Then, we can know that two times four makes eight.\n\n## **Let\'s try other cases** ##\nThere are three boxes, and there are three pencils in each box. How many pencils we have totally?

It consists of two axes, the \"X-axis\" and the \"Y-axis.\"    \n+ The horizontal axis is called the X-axis.  \n+ The vertical axis is called the Y-axis.  \n\nWe can use line graphs to present and analyze real-world data.  \n\nWe need to select a title, a label, an interval, and a scale for the graph.   \n![](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52525262341_058c2d5d8a_z.jpg)  \n\n+ Organize the data with related pairs.\n+ Choose the title, label, an interval, and scale for the graph.\n+ Plot the points in the correlated pairs.\n+ Draw line segments to connect these correlated points.\n\nLet us write related number pairs of the data for the above graph as ordered pairs.  \n![](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52524793467_d9cd2289f4_c.jpg)  \n\n### **Advantages of a Line Graph** ###\n+ They are easy to understand.\n+ It helps to show trends over time.\n+ It helps to show small changes that may be increasingly difficult to detect in other charts.\n+ To compare data, more than one line can be drawn on the same axis.\n\n\n### **Disadvantages of a Line Graph** ###\n+ When the dataset has fractional or decimal values, it becomes difficult to plot.\n+ If we draw too many lines on the same graph, it becomes cluttered and hard to read.\n+ The application is limited to datasets with numeric and integer values.  \n\n\n### **Could you figure out the following questions?** ###  \n![](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52525267226_8b0542013b.jpg)  \n\nAnswer the following questions based on the line graph above.  \n\n![](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52524793542_f79db3824c_b.jpg)  ','[{\"question\": \"Based on the two graphs above, what is the temperature at 2 a.m. in the second graph in degrees Fahrenheit?\", \"choices\": [\"55\", \"45\", \"50\", \"60\"], \"answer\": \"3\"}, {\"question\": \"Based on the two graphs above, what is the temperature at 3 a.m. in the second graph in degrees Fahrenheit?\", \"choices\": [\"55\", \"45\", \"36\", \"34\"], \"answer\": \"0\"}, {\"question\": \"Based on the two graphs above, what is the temperature at 5 a.m. in the second graph in degrees Fahrenheit?\", \"choices\": [\"55\", \"45\", \"50\", \"36\"], \"answer\": \"3\"}, {\"question\": \"With this line graph, we can visually see how the temperature is changing with time?\", \"choices\": [\"Increase\", \"Decrease\"], \"answer\": \"1\"}]'),(10,10,'# Introduction to Algebra\nGrade Level: 5th Grade  \nIn math, we sometimes use letters to represent a value or number. We call these letters or symbols a **Variable**. Typically you will be asked to solve an expression based on the value of a variable or solve an equation to determine the value of a variable. Just as sentences are made up with words and grammar, in math we use ___Terms___ and ___Operators___. A **Term** is any representation of value such as a Variable or Constant. A **Constant** is a term with a fixed defined value (i.e. any literal number). An **Operator** is a representation of any of the basic operations (addition `+`, multiplication `*`, division `/`, and subtraction `-`).\n\n## Expressions vs Equations\n\nA mathematical **Expression** consists of terms and operators:\n- 1 `+` 1\n- 46 `*` a\n- (35 `+` 35) `*` (26 `/` 13)\n- 7z\n\nWhen you set two mathematical expressions equal to each other you have an **Equations**:\n- 1 `+` 1 = 2\n- 46 `*` a = 86\n- (35 `+` 35) `*` (26 `/` 13) = 140\n- 7z = 49\n\n## Application\n\nWe use these concepts when we want to use the same or similar equations to solve problems with multiple use cases.\n\nThought Exercise: Suppose you are planning a family trip and you learn that gas costs $3 per gallon and your car can go 50 miles per gallon.\nThis can be represented as:\n\nx * 50 = m\n\np = 3x\n\nwhere `x` is the number of gallons of gas, `m` is the range in miles, and `p` is the cost of gas.\nSay we want to travel 300 miles to visit your grandparents in another state. How much would that cost? We can say that `m = 300` because 300 is the range in miles which is what `m` represents which gives us:\n\nx * 50 = 300\n\n(x * 50) / 50 = (300) / 50 (divide both sides by 50)\n\nx = 6\n\nThis issue is that solving for `x` doesn\'t give us the cost however we can get the cost with the equation `p = 3x` as `x` is just the number of gallons we need and `p` is the total cost.\n\np = 3(6)\n\np = 18\n\nWe have determined that to travel 300 miles it would cost us $18. As an exercise try to determine how much it would cost to travel 500, 1,000, and 2,400 miles.\n',NULL),(11,11,'# **Data Set** #\nLevel: Math for 6th Grade\n\n## **What is Data Set?** ##\nA dataset is an ordered collection of data, while a collection of information obtained through observation, measurement, research or analysis is called data. This may include information such as facts, figures, numbers, names or even basic descriptions of objects. Data may also be organized in the form of graphs, charts or tables.\n\n## **Example**  \nFor example, with one pizza, two pizzas, four pizzas, and five pizzas, we get data set (1,2,4,5)  \nFor example, for one dollar, five dollars, twenty dollars, and one hundred dollars, we get (1,5,20,100)  \n\n## **Mean, Median, Mode and Range of Datasets** ##\nMean, median and mode as well as range are the main topics of statistics. It is an essential part of our analysis of the data. We must first prepare our data set by rewriting it in ascending order from smallest to largest.\n\n+ The mean of the data set is the average of all observations in the table. It is the ratio of the sum of the observations to the total number of elements present in the dataset. The formula for calculating the mean is as follows: **Mean = sum of observations / total number of elements in the data set**\n\n+ The median of a data set is the middle value of the data set when it is arranged in ascending and descending order.\n\n+ The mode of a dataset is the variable or number or value that is repeated the most times in the dataset.\n\n+ The range of a data set is the difference between the maximum and minimum values: **Range = Maximum value - Minimum value.**\n\n### **Lets see the pizza example here!** ###\n![](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52525870825_b5ccd73358_c.jpg)  \nSo for this case, our MEAN is 3.\n\n![](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52524926137_d0415e5632_c.jpg)  \nSo for this case, our MEDIAN is 4.  \nThen if the number of data is even, then if the number of data is even. We add the two numbers right in the middle and divide them by two, taking the average of the two numbers. Let\'s see the following graph.  \n\n![](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52524926207_b9b964c830_c.jpg)  \nSo for this case, our MEDIAN is 3.5.\n\n![](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52525670689_f4e3851a63_c.jpg)  \nSo for this case, our MODE is 8.\n\n![](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52525670749_894cf5b1f5_c.jpg)  \nSo for this case, our RANGE is 4.\n\n\n### **Could you figure out the following questions?** ###  \n**Data set = {3, 4, 6, 4, 5, 8}**  ','[{\"question\": \"In the above data set, what is the MEAN?\", \"choices\": [\"5\", \"4\", \"8\", \"4.5\"], \"answer\": \"0\"}, {\"question\": \"In the above data set, what is the MEDIAN?\", \"choices\": [\"5\", \"4\", \"8\", \"4.5\"], \"answer\": \"3\"}, {\"question\": \"In the above data set, what is the MODE?\", \"choices\": [\"5\", \"4\", \"8\", \"4.5\"], \"answer\": \"1\"}, {\"question\": \"In the above data set, what is the RANGE?\", \"choices\": [\"5\", \"4\", \"8\", \"4.5\"], \"answer\": \"2\"}]'),(12,12,'# **Introduction to Fractions** #\nLevel: Math for 6th Grade  \n\n## **What is Fraction?** ##\n\nFractions represent parts of a whole or a collection of objects. There are **two** parts to a fraction. The number at the beginning of the line is called **the numerator**, which indicates how many equal parts of the whole or set are occupied. The number at the bottom of the line is called **the denominator**, which shows the total number of equal parts into which the whole is divided or the total number of identical objects in the set. \n\n## **Let\'s use pizza as an example** ##\n![Alt text](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52490757835_6891af411b.jpg)\nLet\'s say I have a whole pizza, but five good friends are coming to my house. I want everyone to enjoy the pizza, but it\'s too late to buy more. So, I decided to divide the pizza into six parts. Please see the picture below.\n\n![Alt text](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52489802972_f5baa9153b_w.jpg)\nOne out of the these six parts can be expressed as one sixth. The number is read as \"1/6\".  But it is important to remember that in this example, dividing into **equal** parts is the only way to be called one-sixth.\n\n\nSo, like this picture, this piece of pizza would not count as one-sixth of the whole pizza. \n\nFractions can be represented in 3 ways: fractions, decimals, or percentages. Let\'s take the example of a quarter, which can be presented as \"1/4\", \"0.25\", or \"25%\".  \n\n## **Let\'s figure out all the types of fractions** ##\n+ Unit fractions  \n    - Fractions with numerator 1.\n    - Example: \"1/8\"\n+ Proper Fractions\n    - Fractions in which the numerator is less than the denominator.\n    - Example: \"3/8\"\n+ Improper Fractions\n    - Fractions in which the numerator is more than or equal to the denominator.\n    - Example: \"11/8\"\n+ Mixed Fractions\n    - Mixed fractions consist of a whole number along with a proper fraction.\n    - Example: \"1(3/8)\"\n+ Like Fractions\n    - Fractions with the same denominators.\n    - Example: \"3/8 and 5/8\"\n+ Unlike Fractions \n    - Fractions with different denominators.\n    - Example: \"3/4 and 5/8\"\n+ Equivalent Fractions\n    - Fractions that have the same value after being simplified or reduced.\n    - Example: \"4/2 and 12/8\"\n\nIf we have two and a half apples, how should we express it?  \n\"2(1/2)\" is the answer, and it is called **mixed fraction**.\n\n### **Could you figure out the following questions?** ###\n![Alt text](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52490571594_5ff0133c76.jpg)   \n\nToday is Anna\'s birthday.
