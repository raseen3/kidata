# **Line Plots** ##
Level: Math for 2nd Grade  
## **What is Line Plots?** ##
A **line plot** is a graph that represents data on a number line using crosses, dots, or any other symbols. Each marker represents a specific quantity, which is the scale of the graph. The number of times a symbol is shown represents how many times a piece of data has occurred. The category of the data is indicated on the number line. We can visually draw marks or symbols on top of the number line to represent each category of variables.

## **Example** ##
Let's look at the following graph. This is a **line plot** which uses the "<span style="color:red">X</span>" above the number line to show the number of the <span style="color:green">students</span> who are absent from school, and the numbers on the number line represent the <span style="color:green">specific number of days</span> student absent.

Based on this picture, how many students were absent from school during the three days? The answer is one. We can see that there is only one <span style="color:red">X</span> above the number line 3.  

How many students were absent for three days or other or more? Let's start by looking at the fact that there is only one student who is absent for three days and only two students who are absent for seven or more days. 1 + 2 = 3, so the answer is 3.  

## How to make a line chart? ##

A line chart is a convenient way to graphically represent data. To create a line chart, follow these steps:  

+ Step 1: Determine the categories of the data. In the example above, data was collected for 4 categories of ice cream flavors: chocolate, strawberry, orange, and vanilla.  
+ 
+ Step 2: Calculate the frequency of each category and represent it using any symbol of your choice. For example, if five kids like chocolate, we draw five symbols ('x') above the chocolate flavor. However, using only one type of symbol in the whole graph is essential. For example, we will not use a dot or cross in a line graph to represent the same thing.  
+ 
+ Step 3: Mention labels and scales. Labels are what we write below the categories in the number line. For example, in the figure above, "favorite flavor" is the label. The scale is the unit or number that each symbol represents. In the figure above, the scale is "1 x = one child".  

However, when we use 1 unit as the scale, you may find many places where the scale is not used. Therefore, when the scale is not mentioned, we treat it as 1 unit. Now let's understand how to analyze or read a line graph.
