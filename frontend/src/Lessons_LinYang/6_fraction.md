Level: Math for 6th Grade  

## **What is Fraction?** ##

Fractions represent parts of a whole or a collection of objects. There are **two** parts to a fraction. The number at the beginning of the line is called **the numerator**, which indicates how many equal parts of the whole or set are occupied. The number at the bottom of the line is called **the denominator**, which shows the total number of equal parts into which the whole is divided or the total number of identical objects in the set. 

## **Let's use pizza as an example** ##

Let's say I have a whole pizza, but five good friends are coming to my house. I want everyone to enjoy the pizza, but it's too late to buy more. So, I decided to divide the pizza into six parts. Please see the picture below.

One out of the these six parts can be expressed as one sixth. The number is read as "1/6".  But it is important to remember that in this example, dividing into **equal** parts is the only way to be called one-sixth.


So, like this picture, this piece of pizza would not count as one-sixth of the whole pizza. 

Fractions can be represented in 3 ways: fractions, decimals, or percentages. Let's take the example of a quarter, which can be presented as "1/4", "0.25", or "25%".  

## **Let's figure out all the types of fractions** ##
+ Unit fractions  
    - Fractions with numerator 1.
    - Example: "1/8"
+ Proper Fractions
    - Fractions in which the numerator is less than the denominator.
    - Example: "3/8"
+ Improper Fractions
    - Fractions in which the numerator is more than or equal to the denominator.
    - Example: "11/8"
+ Mixed Fractions
    - Mixed fractions consist of a whole number along with a proper fraction.
    - Example: "1(3/8)"
+ Like Fractions
    - Fractions with the same denominators.
    - Example: "3/8 and 5/8"
+ Unlike Fractions 
    - Fractions with different denominators.
    - Example: "3/4 and 5/8"
+ Equivalent Fractions
    - Fractions that have the same value after being simplified or reduced.
    - Example: "4/2 and 12/8"

If we have two and a half apples, how should we express it?  
"2(1/2)" is the answer, and it is called **mixed fraction**.

### **Could you figure out the following questions?** ###
