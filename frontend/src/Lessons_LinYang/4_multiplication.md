## **What is Multiplication?** ##

We all know that numbers can be added and subtracted. When we multiply numbers, it is called multiplication. If we need to add the same number more than once, we can use multiplication to do the operation; therefore, multiplication is an extended edition. Multiplication is represented by the "x" symbol.

For example, "2 x 4" we can say "two multiplied by four" or "two times four."   

The first number we multiply by is the number of items in each group. And the second number(the number after "x" sign)is the number of groups.  

Let us say there are two pieces of apples in each group, and there are four groups. So, there are three groups of two pieces of apples each. How many apples do we have? That is "2 + 2 + 2 + 2," which makes eight pieces of apples. Then, we can know that two times four makes eight.

## **Let's try other cases** ##
There are three boxes, and there are three pencils in each box. How many pencils we have totally? So, what we will get? "3 x 3," right? That is "3 + 3 + 3," which makes nine pencils totally.

From this picture, we can see there are three bird houses, and there are four birds in each bird house. How many birds here? "4 x 3," right? That is "4 + 4 + 4," which makes twelve birds totally.

Here is the **Basic Multiplication Table**.
