Level: Math for 3th Grade   

## **What is Division** ##  
The division is the fourth of the basic mathematical operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division). Division means dividing the whole item or a group of objects or dividing them into equal groups. You use division when you need to divide a larger number into smaller and equal parts. Division is represented by the "รท" symbol or "/" symbol.

## **Example** ##
We can better understand the deconstruction method through some examples. First, we can use division as a way to share. For example, you have ten candies, but you have to share this candy with five people. Everyone surely wants the same amount of candy. In this case, 10 is the **dividend**, and 5 is the **divisor**. Therefore, we can get an equation: "10 รท 5". Finally, we can get that each person can get two candies on average. Then, 2 is the quotient.

Just like the above picture, we divide the twelve candies in the bottle into four smaller, equal groups that are divisible. There are three candies in each bowl.

## **Not all numbers are divisible** #

When the divisor cannot be divided by the number of divisors, a "leftovers" is given, called the remainder. Remainder is the remaining number that is left over after division. In the above picture, the remainder is 1.  

For example, if you want to divide 6 by 20, you will find that 6 does not divide 20 evenly. the final quotient is 3, and the remainder is 2. We will get "20 รท 6 = 3 r 2". We write the remainder after an "r" in the answer.

## **Could you figure out the following questions?** ##

1. Including you and Mom, how many equal portions of apple pie do you need to divide?  
A. 3 &ensp; B. 4 &ensp; C. 5(x) &ensp; D. 6
2. In this example, the dividend is ?  
A. 3 &ensp; B. 5 &ensp; C. 18 &ensp; D. 25(x)
3. In this example, the divisor is ?  
A. 3 &ensp; B. 4 &ensp; C. 5(x) &ensp; D. 6
4. In this example, the quotient is ?  
A. 3 &ensp; B. 6 &ensp; C. 9 &ensp; D. 5(x)
5. If we have twenty-six cookies, will the twenty-six cookies be distributed to everyone intact? If not, what is the remaining number?  
A. Yes &ensp; B. No, the remainder is 2 &ensp; C. No, the remainder is 4 &ensp; D. No, the remainder is 1(x)
