## **What is Line Graph?** ##
A line chart, also known as a dashboard or line graph, is a graphical representation of information that changes over time and is often used to display information that changes over time. Use line segments to show how data changes over time.  

You can plot it by using several points connected by straight lines. It consists of two axes, the "X-axis" and the "Y-axis."    
+ The horizontal axis is called the X-axis.  
+ The vertical axis is called the Y-axis.  

We can use line graphs to present and analyze real-world data.  

We need to select a title, a label, an interval, and a scale for the graph.

+ Organize the data with related pairs.
+ Choose the title, label, an interval, and scale for the graph.
+ Plot the points in the correlated pairs.
+ Draw line segments to connect these correlated points.

Let us write related number pairs of the data for the above graph as ordered pairs.

### **Advantages of a Line Graph** ###
+ They are easy to understand.
+ It helps to show trends over time.
+ It helps to show small changes that may be increasingly difficult to detect in other charts.
+ To compare data, more than one line can be drawn on the same axis.


### **Disadvantages of a Line Graph** ###
+ When the dataset has fractional or decimal values, it becomes difficult to plot.
+ If we draw too many lines on the same graph, it becomes cluttered and hard to read.
+ The application is limited to datasets with numeric and integer values.
