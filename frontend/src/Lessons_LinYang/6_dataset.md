# **Data Set** #
Level: Math for 6th Grade

## **What is Data Set?** ##
A dataset is an ordered collection of data, while a collection of information obtained through observation, measurement, research or analysis is called data. This may include information such as facts, figures, numbers, names or even basic descriptions of objects. Data may also be organized in the form of graphs, charts or tables.

## **Example**  
For example, with one pizza, two pizzas, four pizzas, and five pizzas, we get data set (1,2,4,5)  
For example, for one dollar, five dollars, twenty dollars, and one hundred dollars, we get (1,5,20,100)  

## **Mean, Median, Mode and Range of Datasets** ##
Mean, median and mode as well as range are the main topics of statistics. It is an essential part of our analysis of the data. We must first prepare our data set by rewriting it in ascending order from smallest to largest.

+ The mean of the data set is the average of all observations in the table. It is the ratio of the sum of the observations to the total number of elements present in the dataset. The formula for calculating the mean is as follows: **Mean = sum of observations / total number of elements in the data set**

+ The median of a data set is the middle value of the data set when it is arranged in ascending and descending order.

+ The mode of a dataset is the variable or number or value that is repeated the most times in the dataset.

+ The range of a data set is the difference between the maximum and minimum values: **Range = Maximum value - Minimum value.**

### **Lets see the pizza example here!** ###

So for this case, our MEAN is 3.

So for this case, our MEDIAN is 4.  
Then if the number of data is even, then if the number of data is even. We add the two numbers right in the middle and divide them by two, taking the average of the two numbers. Let's see the following graph.

So for this case, our MEDIAN is 3.5.

So for this case, our MODE is 8.

So for this case, our RANGE is 4.
