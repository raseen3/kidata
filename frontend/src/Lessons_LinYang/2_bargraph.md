## **What is Bar Graph?** ##
A bar graph is actually a picture composed of bars of different heights, and each bar represents a category. Let's take a look at the following example.

### **Example**
Anna has three apples, five bananas, and four oranges. Which type of fruit does Anna have the most?

As you can see from the picture above, the number of bananas is the highest.  
So what would it look like if we converted the above graph into a bar graph? Look here.

How about a bar chart? Very simple, isn't it? It always shows us visually the comparison of the quantities between different kinds. Of course, you can also try to draw the bar chart with your favorite pattern. Try it out!

## **The bar graph can also be horizontal!**
The bars in the above graphs are all vertical. Let's try to draw horizontal bar graphs!

## **Example**
A teacher in an elementary school is counting the students' favorite sports. Of the class, eight liked swimming, twelve liked basketball, and four liked football. 

Let's see what the horizontal bar graph will look like.

Through the above examples, I believe we found that although bar graphs are very visual and easy to read, we must pay attention to the title and labeling, as well as the scale (for example, the scale of the third graph is 4, not 1) when we read the bar graphs. Otherwise, we may misunderstand the information given to us by the graphs.

### **Could you figure out the following questions?** ###
