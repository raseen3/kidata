### everything has length, the desk has length, the car has length,etc.   

Length can be seen everywhere in life, and it is also very useful. For example, you don't fit in your mom's shoes, as well as, you mom can't wear your shoes. A person of 2 meters cannot pass through a door of 1.8 meters. He needs to bend down to pass.

We use different units to represent objects of different lengths.

## Measurement ##

We usually use a ruler to measure some smaller things. A length of pen, a length of rubber.  
Usually one scale of a ruler is one millimeter, and 10 scales are one centimeter.

### Ruler measurement  ##
We align the beginning of the object with the scale of 0, and then the other end shows how much, then its length is. 

Or we align one end of an object with a scale and read on the other side, subtracting the number on the right from the number on the left is the length of the object
