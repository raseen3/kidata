# Introduction to Algebra
Grade Level: 5th Grade  
In math, we sometimes use letters to represent a value or number. We call these letters or symbols a **Variable**. Typically you will be asked to solve an expression based on the value of a variable or solve an equation to determine the value of a variable. Just as sentences are made up with words and grammar, in math we use ___Terms___ and ___Operators___. A **Term** is any representation of value such as a Variable or Constant. A **Constant** is a term with a fixed defined value (i.e. any literal number). An **Operator** is a representation of any of the basic operations (addition `+`, multiplication `*`, division `/`, and subtraction `-`).

## Expressions vs Equations

A mathematical **Expression** consists of terms and operators:
- 1 `+` 1
- 46 `*` a
- (35 `+` 35) `*` (26 `/` 13)
- 7z

When you set two mathematical expressions equal to each other you have an **Equations**:
- 1 `+` 1 = 2
- 46 `*` a = 86
- (35 `+` 35) `*` (26 `/` 13) = 140
- 7z = 49

## Application

We use these concepts when we want to use the same or similar equations to solve problems with multiple use cases.

Thought Exercise: Suppose you are planning a family trip and you learn that gas costs $3 per gallon and your car can go 50 miles per gallon.
This can be represented as:

x * 50 = m

p = 3x

where `x` is the number of gallons of gas, `m` is the range in miles, and `p` is the cost of gas.
Say we want to travel 300 miles to visit your grandparents in another state. How much would that cost? We can say that `m = 300` because 300 is the range in miles which is what `m` represents which gives us:

x * 50 = 300

(x * 50) / 50 = (300) / 50 (divide both sides by 50)

x = 6

This issue is that solving for `x` doesn't give us the cost however we can get the cost with the equation `p = 3x` as `x` is just the number of gallons we need and `p` is the total cost.

p = 3(6)

p = 18

We have determined that to travel 300 miles it would cost us $18. As an exercise try to determine how much it would cost to travel 500, 1,000, and 2,400 miles.
