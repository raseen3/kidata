This pie represents the pie chart. Dad eats half of the pie chart, which means he takes 1/2 of the pie chart. Similarly, mother eats half of the pie chart, which is 1/4, and my sister and I share the rest. . That's 1/8 of each, and when they're all put together they make a finished pie. The completeness in piechart is 1, and each part only occupies a part of this 1. The more they occupy, the larger the area embodied in this complete circle.  
then    

| Dad | Mom | Me    | Sister |
|-----|-----|-------|--------|
| 1/2 | 1/4 | 1/8   | 1/8    | 
|     |     | total | 1/1    |
