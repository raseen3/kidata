#  Probability
Grade Level: 4th Grade

We have three answers to how likely an event is to happen: it will definitely happen, it will probably happen, and it will definitely not happen.  

## Possible cases

For the situation that is not absolute, it will distinguish different situations. Classical Probability: How many cases are there when a coin is tossed and lands at the end?  Facing upwards is a 
* human head  
* image  
Two cases might happen, and if one doesn't happen the other will.

According to the picture bellow. if you just pick one ball from the box. which coler will you pick up?   
Green, red, or black.  
Those are all the cases. If the ball you picked is not green, not red, then you must pick black.

## Probability
That is to say, if you take all the cases into account, then the probability that they will happen together is 100%.

According to common sense, the possibility of human heads or patterns appearing is the same. If the experiment is done, as the number of trials increases, the number of occurrences of the two situations will be close to the same

Probability is between 0 and 1.
And one case of probability is number of matches divided by the total. 

Like the box above, what is the probability of picking up a black ball?


P = 3/5
